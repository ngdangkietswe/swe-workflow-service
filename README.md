# SWE-WORKFLOW-SERVICE

This is a simple workflow service that allows users to create, read, update and delete workflows. The service is
built using the
Java Spring Boot framework and gRPC for communication between the client and the server, Kafka for event streaming and
PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerization, and Github Actions for CI/CD.
